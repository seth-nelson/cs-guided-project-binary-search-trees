"""
You are given a binary tree.
​
Write a function that can find the **maximum depth** of the binary tree. The
maximum depth can be defined as the number of nodes found along the longest
path from the root down to the furthest leaf node. Remember, a leaf node is a
node that has no children.
​
Example:
​
Given the following binary tree
​
    5
   / \
  12  32
     /  \
    8    4
​
your function should return the depth = 3.
